Data Analyst Internship at Afame Technologies
        
  Welcome to my Data Analyst internship projects repository. This repository contains the projects I completed as part of my internship at Afame Technologies. The internship provided an opportunity to work on real-world datasets, perform data analysis, and build predictive models. Below is a detailed description of the projects.

Projects Overview

 1. Sales Data Analysis
  
Goal:

 Use sales data analysis to find patterns, identify best-selling items, and compute revenue indicators to assist in business decision-making.

Project Details:

 This project involves delving into a sizable sales dataset to glean insightful information. The main tasks include:
 
       1.Computing total sales.
       2.Analyzing sales trends over time.
       3.Determining the best-selling products.
       4.Building visualizations to convey findings.
     
Activities:

     1.Data cleansing: removing unnecessary columns, renaming columns, 
       eliminating redundant entries, sanitizing specific columns, and 
       handling NaN values.
     2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): identifying sales patterns and 
       trends.
     3.Visualization: creating plots and charts to illustrate key insights.
   
Tools Used:

     1.Python
     2.Pandas
     3.Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualization


2. HR Data Analysis
   
Goal:

 Analyze HR data to understand various employee attributes and their impact on business operations.

Project Details:

 This project focuses on analyzing HR data to extract meaningful insights about employee demographics, job satisfaction, attrition rates, and other key metrics.

Activities:

     1.Data cleansing: similar steps as the sales data analysis.
     2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): understanding employee 
       demographics,job satisfaction levels, and attrition trends.
     3.Visualization: creating plots and charts to illustrate key insights.
   
Tools Used:

     1.Python
     2.Pandas
     3.Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualization

3. Titanic Survival Prediction
   
Goal:

 Build a model to predict whether a passenger on the Titanic survived based on available data.

Project Details:

 The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. This project involves building a predictive model using the Titanic dataset, which contains information about individual passengers such as age, gender, ticket class, fare, cabin, and survival status.

Activities:

     1.Data preprocessing: cleaning and preparing the data for model 
       building.
     2.Feature engineering: creating new features that might help in 
       improving model performance.
     3.Model building: using machine learning algorithms to predict 
       survival.
     4.Model evaluation: assessing the performance of the model using 
       appropriate metrics.

Tools Used:

     1.Python
     2.Pandas
     3.Scikit-learn
     4.Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualization
